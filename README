This is manpageview, which is just a copy of https://github.com/vim-scripts/ManPageView,
except that it hasn't been "withdrawn."  Apparently the karma is low for the vim.org ManPageView
page, so the author withdrew it.  Nope, doesn't make sense to me either!

Here's the original copyright, taken from doc/manpageview.txt.html:
